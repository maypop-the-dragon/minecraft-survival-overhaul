# The Oxeye Project

If there are three things I enjoy, they are probably:
 1. Minecraft
 2. programming
 3. designing things
 4. designing and programming things in Minecraft
 5. buffer overflows
 6. lying
 7. unfunny jokes
 8. dragging on a joke too long

I *want* to like Minecraft Survival mode, but I feel it has some issues...

This project sets out to "fix" modern Minecraft: Java Edition's Survival
gameplay with a set of data packs. Even if you think Minecraft is fine as-is,
you might still enjoy using some of these data packs for a fresh experience!

## Data Packs So Far

### Minimal Structures

- **Status:** Early Concept Development

This data pack will, in general, try to reduce the role of generated structures
in Minecraft's usual progression, to encourage you to engage with the
fundamental systems more instead. Mainly, it removes villages, but it also
reworks every other structure in the game and adds some new ones!

(If you want a village, you will still be able to build your own village and
populate it by curing zombie villagers. I think this will be more fun because it
encourages you to actually build something creative on your own. Beds will
generate as structure loot for compatibility with [No Sleep](#no-sleep).)

### No Sleep

 - **Status:** Finished and Playable!
 - **Pack Version:** v10
 - **Supported Minecraft Versions:** 1.19.3-1.20.6

No Sleep makes a two big gameplay changes:
 - **beds cannot be crafted, picked up, or traded for**
 - **beds do not skip the night** (but can **still set your spawn point**)

These changes make Minecraft harder because:
 - you must actually **wait out the night** or **risk encountering monsters**
 - you can only set your spawn with naturally generated beds such as those in
   villages, so **exploring outside villages is much riskier**

It includes these secondary changes to compensate for the main ones:
 - beds drop logs when broken
 - bonus chests contain one bed
 - phantoms only spawn during new moons
 - shepherd villagers sell dye instead of beds
